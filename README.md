# jason-codes-blog

Testing out a MERN blog style. I would like to see if I can actually use this for an on-going blog. This is something I've wanted to build for a very long time. Let's give it a try!

To bring back mongo: nodemon index.js
To bring back client: npm start

had to add cors: npm add cors

## Other Things Used

- nodemon
- bcrypt [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt]
- jsonwebtoken
